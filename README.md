# DiscordBot
The Discord Bot we need to finish by a few weeks
To use /edit files from this repository use:
"git clone https://github.coventry.ac.uk/alhadd17/DiscordBot/ to download the files"
edit the file and for each change you make use "git add <fileName>" to select the file
and then use git commit -m "message" and add a useful message with what you changed/fixed
then type git push to push your changes.
if you get an error try using git pull before doing that.
